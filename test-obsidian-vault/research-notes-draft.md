# Machine Learning Research Notes

## What I've Been Reading
- Paper about transformer architectures
- Article on attention mechanisms
- Blog post about fine-tuning large language models

## Key Concepts
Transformers use self-attention to process sequences. The attention mechanism lets the model focus on different parts of the input when generating each output token. This is really powerful for language tasks.

Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and training it on your specific dataset. You usually freeze most layers and only train the last few layers. This saves computational resources.

## Questions I Have
- How do you decide which layers to freeze during fine-tuning?
- What's the difference between BERT and GPT architectures?
- How much data do you typically need for effective fine-tuning?

## Next Steps
- Try implementing a simple transformer from scratch
- Experiment with fine-tuning on a small dataset
