**Main Conclusions and Takeaways**

1. The company is transitioning from cloud-based AI services to a local-first AI infrastructure in January 2025, aiming to reduce costs, improve data privacy, and maintain system reliability.
2. Key objectives include reducing monthly AI service costs by 70%, achieving 100% data privacy compliance, and eliminating dependency on external AI service providers.
3. The implementation plan involves three phases: Phase 1 (Q1-12 months), Phase 2 (Q2-2025), and Phase 3 (Q3-2025).

**Important Patterns**

1. The organization is experiencing high monthly AI service costs, which are increasing to $47,000 by the end of Q2 2025.
