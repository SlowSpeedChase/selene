# Bug Tracking & Fixes

This document tracks bugs discovered during development and their resolution status.

## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY BUGS

### BUG #1: Ollama Service Validation
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Discovered**: 2025-01-13 during end-to-end testing
- **Issue**: System assumes Ollama is running, fails with cryptic HTTP errors
- **Evidence**: 
  ```
  Failed to connect to Ollama at http://localhost:11434
  Make sure Ollama is running: 'ollama serve'
  ```
- **Impact**: Poor user experience for new users who haven't started Ollama
- **Root Cause**: No pre-flight checks for Ollama service availability in `OllamaProcessor.__init__`
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `selene/processors/ollama_processor.py`
  - `selene/main.py`
- **Fix Strategy**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  1. ✅ Add connection health check during processor initialization
  2. ✅ Provide clear setup instructions when Ollama isn't available  
  3. 🔄 Add `selene doctor` command for environment diagnosis (pending)
  4. ✅ Graceful error handling with actionable next steps

- **Fix Details**:
  - Added `_validate_ollama_setup()` method in `OllamaProcessor.__init__`
  - Implemented helpful error messages with setup instructions
  - Added model availability checking with suggestions
  - Fixed async event loop conflicts
  - Added `validate_on_init` config option for flexibility

- **Test Results**: 
  ```
  ✅ Ollama validation successful: 2 models available, using phi3:mini
  ✅ Processing completed in 14.29s
  ✅ Generated 2229 characters from 77 character input
  ```

### BUG #2: Model Availability Check
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Discovered**: 2025-01-13 during end-to-end testing
- **Issue**: System defaults to `llama3.2` without checking if it's installed
- **Evidence**:
  ```
  404 - {"error":"model 'llama3.2' not found"}
  ```
- **Impact**: Default configuration doesn't work out-of-box
- **Root Cause**: No model existence validation before processing
- **Files Affected**:
  - `selene/processors/ollama_processor.py:29` (default model)
  - `selene/main.py:64` (CLI default)

- **Fix Strategy**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  1. ✅ Smart model fallback system with preference ranking
  2. ✅ Automatic model selection based on availability
  3. ✅ User notification of model changes
  4. ✅ CLI integration with selected model

- **Fix Details**:
  - Added `_find_best_available_model()` with intelligent ranking
  - Implemented model fallback in validation with warning messages
  - Fixed CLI to use processor's selected model instead of original parameter
  - Added comprehensive model preference system (llama → mistral → phi → fallbacks)

- **Test Results**: 
  ```
  ⚠️  Model 'llama3.2' not found, using 'llama3.2:1b' instead
  ✅ Processing completed in 6.27s with auto-selected model
  ✅ File processing with output generation successful
  ```

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### BUG #3: No Graceful Fallback
- **Status**: 📋 PENDING
- **Issue**: When Ollama fails, no automatic fallback to cloud processor
- **Impact**: System completely unusable without local setup

### ENHANCEMENT #4: Missing Setup Commands
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (`selene doctor`)
- **Issue**: No built-in way to check/setup Ollama environment
- **Proposed**: Add `selene doctor` and `selene setup` commands

- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added comprehensive `selene doctor` command
  - Python version validation
  - Ollama service and model diagnostics
  - OpenAI API key detection
  - Dependency verification
  - Smart recommendations with ready-to-use commands

- **Doctor Command Features**:
  ```
  🩺 Selene System Diagnostics
  🐍 Python Version Check
  🏠 Local AI (Ollama) Diagnostics
  ☁️ Cloud AI (OpenAI) Diagnostics  
  📦 Dependencies Check
  🎯 Smart Recommendations
  ```

### ENHANCEMENT #5: Model Management
- **Status**: 📋 PENDING
- **Issue**: No automatic model pulling or suggestions
- **Proposed**: Auto-suggest model installation commands
