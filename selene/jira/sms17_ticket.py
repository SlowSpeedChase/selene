# SMS-17: File Monitoring and Auto-Processing System

## Objective
Implement real-time file monitoring system that automatically processes new and changed files with AI capabilities.

## Features to Implement
- 🔄 Real-time directory monitoring with watchdog
- 📁 Configurable watched directories and file patterns
- 🗃️ Processing queue system for batch operations
- 🤖 Automatic AI processing of detected files
- 🗄️ Auto-storage in vector database for searchability
- ⚙️ CLI commands for monitoring management
- 📊 Processing status and statistics tracking

## Technical Components
1. **File Watcher Service**: Real-time file system monitoring
2. **Processing Queue**: Async queue for handling file operations
3. **Auto-Processor**: Integration with existing AI processors
4. **Vector Integration**: Automatic document storage and indexing
5. **Management CLI**: Commands for start/stop/status/config

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Monitors multiple directories simultaneously
- ✅ Handles file creation, modification, and deletion events
- ✅ Processes files automatically with configurable AI tasks
- ✅ Stores processed content in vector database
- ✅ Provides real-time status and progress tracking
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ User-friendly CLI interface

## Status: IN PROGRESS
Currently implementing file monitoring architecture and queue system.
