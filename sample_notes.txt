Machine Learning Project Meeting - January 13, 2025

Attendees: Sarah (PM), Mike (ML Engineer), Lisa (Data Scientist), Tom (Backend)

Key Discussion Points:
- Current model accuracy is 82% on validation set
- Need to improve data preprocessing pipeline
- Dataset has quality issues - missing values in 15% of records
- Training time is too long (8 hours on current hardware)
- Model interpretability is a concern for stakeholders

Action Items:
1. Lisa to clean dataset and handle missing values by next week
2. Mike to experiment with feature selection to reduce training time
3. Tom to optimize data loading pipeline
4. Sarah to schedule stakeholder meeting for model explanation

Technical Details:
- Using Random Forest with 100 trees
- Features: 45 numerical, 12 categorical
- Target: binary classification (churn prediction)
- Current precision: 0.78, recall: 0.85

Next Meeting: January 20, 2025
