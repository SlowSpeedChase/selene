AI Research Notes - Local LLM Performance Study

Date: January 13, 2025
Researcher: Dr. Sarah Chen

## Abstract
This study examines the performance characteristics of locally-deployed Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to cloud-based alternatives. We focus on privacy, latency, cost, and quality metrics across different model sizes and hardware configurations.

## Key Findings

### Performance Metrics
- Local models (7B parameters): 15-30 tokens/second on consumer hardware
- Cloud models: 50-100 tokens/second but with 200-500ms network latency
- Quality scores: Local models achieve 85-92% of cloud model performance
- Privacy: 100% data retention locally vs. potential cloud data exposure

### Hardware Requirements
- Minimum: 16GB RAM for 7B models
- Recommended: 32GB RAM + GPU for optimal performance
- Storage: 4-14GB per model depending on quantization

### Cost Analysis
- Local deployment: One-time hardware cost ($500-2000)
- Cloud services: $0.001-0.03 per 1K tokens (ongoing costs)
- Break-even point: ~50,000 tokens for local setup

## Research Questions
1. How does quantization affect model quality vs. performance?
2. What is the optimal model size for different use cases?
3. Can fine-tuning improve local model performance for specific domains?
4. How do local models handle different languages and technical domains?

## Next Steps
- Conduct comparative evaluation across 5 different model architectures
- Measure energy consumption and environmental impact
- Develop benchmarking framework for local AI deployment
- Create guidelines for model selection based on use case requirements
