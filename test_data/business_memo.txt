MEMORANDUM

TO: All Development Teams
FROM: Alex Rodriguez, CTO
DATE: January 13, 2025
SUBJECT: Migration to Local-First AI Infrastructure

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Effective Q2 2025, our organization will transition from cloud-based AI services to a local-first AI infrastructure. This strategic shift aims to enhance data privacy, reduce operational costs, and improve system reliability.

BACKGROUND
Current monthly AI service costs have reached $47,000, with projections indicating $650,000 annually by end of year. Additionally, recent data privacy regulations require us to maintain tighter control over customer information processing.

KEY OBJECTIVES
• Reduce AI processing costs by 70% within 12 months
• Achieve 100% data privacy compliance
• Eliminate dependency on external AI service providers
• Maintain or improve current processing quality standards

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Phase 1 (Q1 2025): Infrastructure Setup
- Procure local GPU hardware (Budget: $85,000)
- Install Ollama and selected open-source models
- Train internal team on local AI deployment
- Establish performance benchmarking protocols

Phase 2 (Q2 2025): Gradual Migration
- Migrate non-critical AI workloads to local infrastructure
- Run parallel systems for quality comparison
- Document performance metrics and user feedback
- Refine local model configurations

Phase 3 (Q3 2025): Full Deployment
- Complete migration of all AI workloads
- Decommission cloud AI services
- Implement monitoring and maintenance protocols
- Conduct team training on new workflows

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
- Hardware Investment: $85,000 (one-time)
- Personnel: 2 FTE for 6 months (setup and training)
- Training Budget: $15,000
- Estimated ROI: 18 months

RISKS AND MITIGATION
Risk: Initial setup complexity
Mitigation: Dedicated project team with external consulting support

Risk: Temporary performance degradation
Mitigation: Gradual migration with rollback capabilities

Risk: Team learning curve
Mitigation: Comprehensive training program and documentation

NEXT STEPS
1. Secure budget approval from Finance (Due: Jan 20)
2. Form implementation task force (Due: Jan 25)
3. Begin hardware procurement process (Due: Feb 1)
4. Initiate team training programs (Due: Feb 15)
